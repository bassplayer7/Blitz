# Dutch Blitz - an un-official scoreboard for the game

Play the game: **[jessemaxwell.com](https://jessemaxwell.com/)**

----

The goal of this scoreboard is to make keeping track of score during a game of Dutch Blitz (or whatever) incredibly easy. No more sheets of paper with lines of scores. Simply enter the score at the end of each round. The app keeps track of who is in the lead (or if they are tied) and how many points until the end of the game. You can even change the players' colors to match the color of their deck of cards.

Access the score board at [jessemaxwell.com](https://jessemaxwell.com/). Pull requests, code reviews, suggestions, and bug reports are all *welcome*.
