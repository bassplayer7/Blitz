# JesseMaxwell.com Code

> This is the code for apps built by Jesse Maxwell. That's me. I say "apps" because there are two. One was built with KnockoutJS (/blitz) and everything else was built more recently using VueJS.

## Build Setup

It's all classic VueJS CLI stuff, so to build: `yarn run dev`, or `yarn run build`. 

## The Other Details

This is one project where I don't worry about supporting older browsers. That's pretty nice for me. Of course, if you are using Internet Explorer, well, it won't work too great.
